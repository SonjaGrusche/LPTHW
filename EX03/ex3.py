# + "plus" does addition
# - "minus" does subtraction
# / "slash" does division
# * "asterisk" does multiplication
# % "percent" does modulus calculation (divides and displays the remainder)
# < "less-than" says if the number before the character < is smaller than the number behind it by giving the statement "True" or "False"
# > "greater-than" says if the number before the character > is greater than the number behind it by giving the statement "True" or "False"
# <= "less-than-equal" says if the number before the characters <= is smalleror equal than the number behind it by giving the statement "True" or "False"
# >= "greater-than-equal" says if the number before the characters >= is greater or equal than the number behind it by giving the statment "True" or "False"
