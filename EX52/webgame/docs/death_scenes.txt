'bedroom'
As Billy closes the door of his parent's room,
he remembers that he played with his plush turtle on his parent's bed yesterday evening.
The second Billy rushes to open the door again something snaps his leg.
The room fills with an agonized cry.
Damn it.

'pacman'
Billy goes over to the drawer. PacMan isn't moving. He knew it, PacMan is harmless!
As Billy bends over the drawer to find the flashlight PacMan rolls forward and eats his head.
Damn it.

'orange'
Billy throws the orange towards the dining table. PacMan immediatly rolls off the countertop.
Oh no, Billy cannot see him anymore. Before he could take a step backwards PacMan jumps at him and eats his head.
Damn it.

'pokeball'
Billy throws the Pokeball at Pikachu.
Oh no! He won't enter it!
Pikachu hates Pokeballs.
Billy is too slow, Pikachu's lightsaber separates Billy's head from his body.
Damn it.
